# Medicine Tracker ðŸ’Š

A full-stack web application built to simplify **medication management and inventory tracking**. This tracker helps users stay organized by keeping all their prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, and supplements in one place.

I was inspired to create this after getting sick while traveling in India in the summer of 2025, when I was prescribed numerous unfamiliar pills, syrups, and tablets. Managing them all quickly became overwhelming, so I designed this tracker to help myselfâ€”and others in similar situationsâ€”stay organized, track doses, and avoid expired medications.
